<header> <h1>The Myth of the Bad Apple</h1> </header>

<p>This might be a persuasive argument, were there any evidence that it were true. There is not.</p> 

<p>Hoover was not the lone madman running around the FBI. He may have been a pioneer in that brand of madness; but he was in no way the sole individual; he was one of many.</p> 

<p>The truth is that it is the institutions that are the true arbiters of behavior because they define for the individuals the boundaries of what is both permissible and possible.</p> 

<p>It is widely acknowledged that the CIA has always operated as a means of plausible deniability for the executive office when illegal or unconstitutional action is called for. Writing in 1976, Victor Marchetti noted that “one of the advantages a secret agency like the CIA provides to a President is the unique pretext of being able to disclaim responsibility for its actions.” Presidents will “direct or approve high-risk clandestine operations,” Marchetti said, and if these sensitive or controversial missions fail “or backfire, then usually all the President and his staff need do to avoid culpability is to blame the CIA.” Therefore, the institution is, itself, set up as a means for conspiracy, as a backdoor when legal or constitutional constraints prove too limiting.</p>  

<p>The CIA’s very charter was written to excuse it from traditional restrictions; its whole reason for being is as a utility that functions outside the boundaries of domestic or international law, and that finds no real meaningful constraints in the U.S. constitution.</p> 

<p>And though figures like Nixon and Hoover were, indeed, savvy bureaucrats, skilled at directing men and exacting results, its also true that for organizations like the FBI or CIA figureheads such as directors are more symbolic than anything. More often than not they serve as a "public" face of the institution. Marchetti wrote that the CIA director was not "a dominant--or much interested--figure in the direction and management of the intelligence community which he supposedly headed."</p>  

<p>Similarly, Nixon is largely remembered as a flawed personality; yet to endorse this mythology forgets the fact that he was. The Watergate revelations were not simply a matter of issues in-house to the Presidency; they related to conspiracies and government secrets relevant to the Department of Defense, the CIA, the FBI, the Bureau of Justice, and numerous other agencies. The CIA psychological profile on Daniel Ellsberg, for instance, commissioned by the White House "plumbers" while they schemed to tar and discredit him for having revealed that the Pentagon had been lying about the Vietnam War for twenty years, was hardly a scheme that lacked relevance or motive for others besides Nixon. All of the blatantly illegal operations of the Plumbers were carried out in broad daylight and in front of and with the help of other federal agencies. Nobody cried foul or reported them. The only people that ended up actually caring about the President’s actions ended up being two small-time reporters at the Washington Post.</p> 

<p>Americans also tend to forget that Watergate was merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of the political scandals of the 1970s. In the years after the Nixon resigned, myriad investigatory committees–Pike, Church, and Rockefeller, among others–would show that illegal, unconstitutional actions were routinely taken by most agencies of the U.S. intelligence and military community. Secret assassinations of foreign leaders and American citizens, seemingly endless evidence of wiretapping and surveillance, proof of widespread dissemination of propaganda and psychological warfare campaigns, illegal human experimentation, a quixotic quest by the CIA to create brainwashed assassins through mind control and LSD, and a standard operating procedure at the FBI known as a "black bag job" (really just federal jargon for warrantless breaking and entering), were some, among many, many revelations.</p>  

<p>Hoover’s mid-century spying on Americans can only be dubbed a product of the FBI director’s flawed character if one ignores or is ignorant of the CIA’s simultaneous Operation CHAOS.</p> 

<p>Similarly, it takes a decent amount of either cognitive dissonance or outright ignorance to look upon the NSA’s contemporary domestic spying as the result of rogue individuals. These prerogatives–to monitor, analyze, classify and catalogue–belong to the institutions themselves, not a few bad apples. Those “bad apples,” often highly successful career officers, perhaps excel for the very reason that their priorities so well match those of the institution that they work for.</p>   

<p>Finally, the precedent set by these very institutions–that–would seem to imply that operations of this type are the rule, not the exception. It would be deeply ironic if federal agencies that deeply valued legal or constitutional action were so incessantly caught up in scandals that showed widespread disregard for both. Such repetitive and routine dissonance between objectives and results would seem to suggest a deep incompetence. However, the truth is fairly more disturbing: that these institutions are deeply competent. It’s what they’re competent at that’s the problem.</p>

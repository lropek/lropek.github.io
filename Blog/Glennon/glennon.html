<header><h1>The National Security State according to Michael J. Glennon</h1></header>

<p>Glennon’s article, titled “Trump’s looming showdown with the secret government,” could have been perfectly at home on InfoWars.</p>

<p>This has largely been Glennon’s gift–the ability to legitimize ideas and fears that would otherwise be relegated to the realm of the "paranoid" or conspiracy theory.</p> 

<p>Glennon’s book, National Security and Double Government, wasn't published on a blog but by the Oxford University Press, while positing a theory not dissimilar to something that would fall within the purvey of Alex Jones. The book is tactful as it is persuasive.</p> 

<p><h2>Madisonian institutions and the Trumanite network</h2></p> 

<p>Glennon’s understanding of the U.S. government revolves around a political  theory developed by 19th century British journalist Walter Bagehot called “double government.” Bagehot posited that the Great Britain had drifted into a form of governance with two faces--one public,  

<p>Glennon thus divides our current political institutions into two distinct categories–those established by the framework set down by James Madison in the U.S. constitution, and those established in 1947 when Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act and created the CIA.</p> 

<p>Some might argue that Glennon’s book sacrifices honesty for tact. Glennon argues repeatedly that “through no intentional conspiracy,” the U.S. has moved into a form of double government. Yet how Glennon might possibly know what the intentions of the secret cadres functioning within the government might be is hard to say.</p> 

<p><h2>Falling to Earth</h2></p>

<p>“It is not clear what precisely would occur,” Glennon states. “United States history provides no precedent.”</p>  

<p>The alternative scenario is much more ominous.</p>  

<p>“The government itself, meanwhile, could not be counted upon to remain passive in the face of growing public obduracy in response to its efforts to do what it thinks essential to safe-guard national security,” Glennon states.</p> 

<p>“Here we do have historical precedents, and none is comfortably revisited. The Alien and Sedition Acts in the 1790s; the Palmer Raids of 1919 and 1920; the round-up of Japanese-American citizens in the 1940s; governmental spying on and disruption of civil rights, draft protesters, and anti-war activists in the 1960s and 1970s; and the incommunicado incarceration without charges, counsel or trial of “unlawful combatants” on a few short years ago – are all examples of what can happen when government sees limited options in confronting nerve-center security threats.”</p>

Glennon blames “pervasive civic ignorance” for the enduring power of the Trumanite structures.

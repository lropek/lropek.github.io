		<h1>The ATF's black operations</h1>
	</header>

<p>One of the more intriguing and less covered political scandals of last year involved the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which is currently being sued by a collective of tobacco farmers in North Carolina. According to the lawsuit, the ATF has, for years, engaged in the sale of “tens of millions of dollars” in black market cigarettes as a method of funding secret, undercover operations.</p> 

<p>The lawsuit states ATF agents allegedly made the fraudulent sales using a front company, then deposited the money into a secret slush fund that was used to finance law enforcement operations, according to a report published by the New York Times in February.</p>  

<p>Slush funds, also sometimes called “black funds,” are generally covert financial accounts used for illegal purposes.</p>  

<p>“It is unclear how broadly the A.T.F. adopted this practice, at what level it was approved, and whether it continues,” wrote NYT reporter Matt Apuzzo in February.</p> 

<p>Further investigation showed that federal agents used the proceeds from the fraudulent sales not only to fund operations but to pay for personal expenses including a pleasure trip to Las Vegas, a $21,000 suite at a NASCAR race, and a generous private donation to the school of one of the agents’ children.</p>

		<h1>The ATF's black operations</h1>
	</header>

<p>One of the more intriguing and less covered political scandals to occur last year involved the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF is currently being sued by a collective of tobacco farmers in North Carolina, who allege that the agency has, for years, engaged in the sale of “tens of millions of dollars” in black market cigarettes as a method of funding secret, undercover operations.</p> 

<p>The lawsuit states ATF agents allegedly made the fraudulent sales using a front company, then deposited the money into a secret slush fund that was used to finance law enforcement operations, according to a report published by the New York Times in February.</p>  

<p>Slush funds, also sometimes called “black funds,” are generally covert financial accounts used for illegal purposes.</p>  

<p>“It is unclear how broadly the A.T.F. adopted this practice, at what level it was approved, and whether it continues,” wrote NYT reporter Matt Apuzzo in February.</p> 

<p>Further investigation showed that federal agents used the proceeds from the fraudulent sales not only to fund operations but to pay for personal expenses including a pleasure trip to Las Vegas, a $21,000 suite at a NASCAR race, and a generous private donation to the school of one of the agents’ children.</p>

<p>It has been alleged for years that federal agencies frequently engage in illicit trafficking as a means of funding covert operations. The supposed logic behind such transactions goes as follows: When planning "black" operations, sales from illegal drugs or other goods provide an untraceable means of funding, further cloaking whatever illegal or unsanctioned activity being pursued under an additional blanket of plausible deniability; if there's no federal money trail, even less evidence exists to prove that said operation ever actually occurred.</p> 

<p>Similarly, the sheer magnitude of money to be made in black markets and the relative ease with which federal authorities can access these markets through the many back channels developed to hunt such criminals, makes it an invisible goldmine capable of funding secret operations with costs in the millions of dollars.</p>

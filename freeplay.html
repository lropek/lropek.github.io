<p>The nail in the communists’ coffin came in 1954, when the Shah’s government passed the Subversive Activities Control Act–essentially anti-Communist legislation–that outlawed the Tudeh party and resulted in the “effective crushing of Tudeh activities within Iran,” says Iranian scholar Jahangir Amuzegar.</p>

<p>The law reinforced a legal basis for the government’s already overt anticommunist campaign, and led to the continual “suppression, arrest, prosecution, and punishment of militant Communist cadres,” Amuzegar says. By the end of 1955 the Communists “had been almost entirely wiped out.”</p>  

<p>Much of this political clamp down was accomplished with U.S. support. In 1953, shortly after the coup, a small coalition of CIA and Israeli Mossad agents assisted the Shah’s new government in establishing its own intelligence organization: the State Security and Intelligence Organization, or as it was commonly known “SAVAK.”</p>

<p>Dubbed by TIME Magazine as “Iran’s most hated and feared institution,” one characterized by “virtually unlimited powers to arrest and interrogate” and that had “tortured and murdered thousands of the Shah’s opponents,” SAVAK became known for its brutality, societal omnipresence, and infamous “abuses.”</p>

<p>In 1976, Amnesty International (AI) released a report expressing concerns about SAVAK’s iron grip on the country. “Suppression of political opposition is carried out by SAVAK with a system of extreme ruthlessness,” the report alleges, describing the methods the military agency had used to suppress political dissidence and regulate social order.</p>

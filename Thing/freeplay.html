<p><h2>Part Two: SAVAK and the Crushing of Iranian Communism</h2></p>

<p>The nail in the communists’ coffin came in 1954, when the Shah’s government passed the Subversive Activities Control Act–essentially anti-Communist legislation–that outlawed the Tudeh party and resulted in the “effective crushing of Tudeh activities within Iran,” says Iranian scholar Jahangir Amuzegar.</p>

<p>The law reinforced a legal basis for the government’s already overt anticommunist campaign, and led to the continual “suppression, arrest, prosecution, and punishment of militant Communist cadres,” Amuzegar says. By the end of 1955 the Communists “had been almost entirely wiped out.”</p>  

<p>Much of this political clamp down was accomplished with U.S. support. In 1953, shortly after the coup, a small coalition of CIA and Israeli Mossad agents assisted the Shah’s new government in establishing its own intelligence organization: the State Security and Intelligence Organization, or as it was commonly known “SAVAK.”</p>

<p>Dubbed by TIME Magazine as “Iran’s most hated and feared institution,” one characterized by “virtually unlimited powers to arrest and interrogate” and that had “tortured and murdered thousands of the Shah’s opponents,” SAVAK became known for its brutality, societal omnipresence, and infamous “abuses.”</p>

<p>In 1976, Amnesty International (AI) released a report expressing concerns about SAVAK’s iron grip on the country. “Suppression of political opposition is carried out by SAVAK with a system of extreme ruthlessness,” the report alleges, describing the methods the military agency had used to suppress political dissidence and regulate social order.</p>

<p>That same year, a report by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) expressed concern for how the country’s “movement towards greater parliamentary democracy since World War II” had “yielded to an authoritarian one-party regime.”</p>

<p>In the AI’s report, researchers painted a dire picture of Iranian society, showing that, since the coup, it had quickly slipped into totalitarian militarism. “Freedom of speech and association are nonexistent,” the report alleges.</p>

<p>To enforce this rigid social order, SAVAK had taken to using a “system of informers that permeates all levels of Iranian society.” These informers had successfully “created an atmosphere of fear” throughout the country, one frequently “remarked on by visitors to Iran,” the AI report showed.</p>  

<p>That fear was rooted in the fact that, after the Shah returned to power, Iranians were commonly “disappeared” off the streets, whisked away to hidden torture chambers, then cast before the judgement of secret military tribunals. Many were never seen again by friends and family. This may have been because, as the AI report stated, “allegations of death under torture are not uncommon.”</p>

<p>According to one senior officer in the intelligence corp, punishments for suspected Communist guerrillas and other alleged political dissidents ran a grotesque gamut that included the use of rape, sleep deprivation, glaring lights, live snakes, electrical cattle prods, solitary confinement and nail pulling. Other allegations suggested political prisoners were regularly subjected to scenarios in which they were hung upside down by their feet, beaten, then burned on their faces and bodies with hot poking irons.</p>

<p>As purges and terror escalated throughout Iranian society, U.S. officials allegedly maintained close ties to the monstrous organization they had helped to create. Indeed, according to a 1979 New York Times article, many of the torture methods deployed by SAVAK personnel on their victims were taught to them through “CIA torture seminars” that were based “on German torture techniques from World War II.”</p>

<p>The continued relationship between American intelligence services and the Iranians led in 1959 to a bilateral agreement that allowed CIA agents to work covertly within Iran, and, in turn, allowed SAVAK agents to operate in America.</p> 

<p>During senate hearings held in 1979, federal agents confessed that Iranian personnel were deeply embedded within American society–so embedded, in fact, that SAVAK agents were reported to be very “involved in conditioning U.S. opinions toward the shah and toward the Iranian-U.S. alliance” through various forms of propaganda, even going so far as to fund pro-Shah demonstrations in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The operations didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>Richard Cottam, a former CIA agent who became a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh, reported to the FBI in 1976 that “Iranian assassination squads were in the United States.” These death squads, according to Cottam, were being used to target American citizens and students who expressed critical views of the Pahlavi regime. The modus operandi of the hit men was to “make executions appear to be common crimes such as muggings,” Cottam said.</p>

<p>A Washington Post article from the period describes an incident in which SAVAK personnel attempted to murder a student activist:</p>

<p>“In January, 1978, an official of the Iranian Students Association - the leading anti-shah group in this country - was lured to a meeting in Chico, Calif., where five bullets were fired at him. All missed. One of the two Iranians suspected of the shooting attempt was later linked to SAVAK in a Justice Department report to the National Security Council. The two accused assailants were acquitted at their trial.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason that the FBI did little with this information was that it too was collaborating with members of SAVAK, who would volunteer “detailed information on Iranian student organizations in the United States” to the Bureau, which, in turn “reciprocated with information.”</p>

<p>Further reports and investigations by human rights groups throughout the 1970s would continue to shed light on the ongoing relationship between the U.S. government and SAVAK, as well as the abuses, disappearances, and purges that characterized Iranian society under the Shah’s rule. SAVAK’s reign would continue until the Iranian revolution of 1977-79 when the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown by leftist and Islamicist insurgencies, ultimately to be replaced by the Iranian monarchy led by the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In the years after the revolution, American reporters visits to abandoned torture chambers in Tehran would finally provide the western public with insight into “the emotional accusations by Iranians of U.S. responsibility in a quarter-century of torture and repression under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.”</p>

<p><h2>Introduction: New Disclosures</h2></p>

<p>Last June, as U.S. officials flirted with support for a policy of “regime change” in Iran, the American government quietly published a trove of documents further detailing its role in the 1953 coup that deposed democratically elected Iranian leader Mohammad Mossadegh and installed dictator Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.</p>

<p>Though it has been widely acknowledged for decades that the Americans were behind the coup, official disclosures were limited until recently. In the 1990s, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials reported that the Agency had “destroyed or lost almost all the documents” associated with the coup decades earlier, and it wasn’t until 2013 that the operation was publicly acknowledged for the first time.</p>

<p>The new documents, declassified and released June 15, shed further light on the detailed planning between government agencies–namely the State Department and the CIA–in the period prior to, during, and immediately after the implementation of the coup.</p>

<p>The violent overthrow, codenamed “Operation AJAX,” would effectively curb Iranian parliamentary democracy, ushering in a new era of repression at the hands of Reza and American-backed security forces unseen in the country’s modern history.</p>

<p><h2>Part One: A Violent Day</h2></p>

<p>On the morning of the coup, a crowd of men gather in Tehran.</p> 

<p>The crowd, which had been secretly hired by the CIA, armed themselves with bats and marched into the city’s central bazaar where they were joined by a cadre of disenfranchised police and army units that had also agreed to support the Americans’ plan. The secrecy of the U.S. role in the operation made the group look like an organic uprising rather than a hired mob.</p> 

<p>Prior to the day’s events, the CIA had also flooded communities throughout the country with “black propaganda”–fake newspapers and publications that sought to discredit and inspire anger and resentment towards the Mossadegh government.</p>   

<p>On the day in question, the crowd quickly morphed into “mobs running riot through the streets,” states journalist David Talbot. Some 200 people were killed in the ensuing carnage.</p>

<p>By noon, the pro-Shah forces had taken control of the streets. Militants stormed and held the local government offices, then later hijacked the Tehran news service–proceeding to broadcast to the city’s residents about the fall of the Mossadegh government.</p> 

<p>Militants later stormed Mossadegh’s home, “gutting” it. Pro-Mossadegh politicians and officers were arrested or attacked. In the ensuing mayhem, one of the officers in charge of defending the prime minister’s residence was literally “torn limb from limb by the rampaging mob,” Talbot states.</p> 

<p>Mossadegh himself barely escaped over his own rooftop and was captured and forced to surrender the next day. He would be imprisoned for three years before being forced into exile for the rest of his life. The Shah opted not to execute him so as not to make him into a martyr.</p>

<p><h2>Part Two: Overthrowing Democracy</h2></p>

<p>Like many other Cold War interventions, the U.S.’s justification for the coup involved two symbiotic concerns: the alleged fear of Communist influence in foreign nations, and the maintenance of western business and political interests.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years Iran had been subject to exploitation by colonial powers, with its great economic asset–its oil–ever the object of competing exploitation and competion by foreign nations.</p> 

<p>From the turn of the 20th century until 1949, the majority of Iran’s oil was subject to a petroleum search concession (a legal agreement granting oil rights that essentially amounted to a license to steal) by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC)–a large energy corporation whose primary shareholder was the British government.</p> 

<p>The British were never good partners in business or politics. AIOC pocketed the majority of the profits from production, while Brit officials meddled in Iran’s internal affairs.</p>  

<p>Despite this, the country’s political structure grew steadily more open and democratic throughout the first half of the 20th century–due largely to the efforts of progressive political leaders like Mossadegh.</p> 

<p>Before being appointed as prime minister, Mossadegh had a long career in the Iranian parliament, fighting to disentangle the country’s political affairs from the grip of foreign nations. By the 1950s, he had accumulated a large following and formed a new political party, the National Front–comprised of labor organizers and advocates for Iranian sovereignty. In the years before the coup, the National Front would win a majority of seats within parliament, becoming a powerful force in Iranian politics.</p>   

<p>The Shah would ultimately install Mossadegh in 1951 as a concession to the populist movements that he represented, but Pahlavi feared his new prime minister’s popularity.</p> 

<p>As the Shah watched with ever more concern, Mossadegh increasingly pressed his revolutionary platform of self-determination–an important goal of which was economic ownership of the country’s resources. His efforts led, in 1951, to parliament’s overwhelming vote to nationalize the country’s oil supplies.</p> 

<p>The decision naturally outraged British businessmen and officials, and a bitter four-year feud between the Iranian government and the AIOC erupted.</p>

<p>Documents declassified in August show that British Foreign Office officials repeatedly approached the Truman administration, asking that the Americans assist in instigating a coup against Mossadegh so that a government might be installed that was a more “reliable” business partner.</p>  

<p>Truman never signed off on the operation but Eisenhower eventually would.</p> 

<p>Newly released minutes of National Security Council (NSC) meetings show American officials were equally concerned over the region’s energy resources–but as a geopolitical asset rather than an economic necessity.</p> 

<p>What worried the Americans was not the money necessarily, but that the Tudeh Party–Iran’s predominant socialist political organization–might be funded by the Soviets. The Tudeh were bedfellows with Mossadegh’s administration. In the mind of U.S. cold warriors, the idea of Iran’s valuable energy resources falling into the hands of Communists was a horrifying prospect.</p>  

<p>In a memo dated March 1, 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles worried to President Eisenhower that “a steady decrease in the power and influence of the Western democracies” regionally might lead to the “building up of a situation where a Communist takeover is becoming more and more of a possibility.”</p>

<p>During a NSC meeting three days later, Dulles again pressed the Council to consider the importance of maintaining control over Iran’s energy resources–warning NSC members that, should Iran fall into Communist hands, the “free world” would “be deprived of the enormous assets represented by Iranian oil production and reserves” and that before long “the other areas of the Middle East, with some 60% of the world’s oil reserves, would fall into Communist control.”</p>

<p>The coup would ultimately return the means of Iranian oil production back into the hands of western capitalists, and in 1954–less than a year after the deposing of Mossadegh–AIOC would resume production. In the ensuing years U.S. oil companies would take over nearly half of the country’s petroleum production. More importantly for the Americans, Iran’s political leadership would be wrested from those sympathetic to a socialist regime and would be delivered, instead, into the hands of the CIA.</p>  

<p><h2>Part Three: SAVAK and the Crushing of Iranian Communism</h2></p>

<p>After the coup had restored the Shah to power, American officials set about helping him to “create the dictatorship he had always planned,” according to academic Ervand Abrahamian. The first step in this process was the eradication of political opposition forces in Iran, namely those aligned with socialism or communism.</p>

<p>The primary target of this crackdown was the Tudeh–which western forces alleged had deep ties to the Soviet Union.</p> 

<p>After the overthrow of Mosaddegh, the Tudeh were quickly crushed, with some 3,000 party activists being arrested and an underground network of Tudeh affiliates within the Iranian military rooted out, imprisoned or executed.</p>   

<p>The nail in the communists’ coffin came in 1954, when the Shah’s government passed the Subversive Activities Control Act–essentially anti-Communist legislation–that outlawed the Tudeh party and resulted in the “effective crushing of Tudeh activities within Iran,” says Iranian scholar Jahangir Amuzegar.</p>

<p>The law reinforced a legal basis for the government’s already overt anticommunist campaign, and led to the continual “suppression, arrest, prosecution, and punishment of militant Communist cadres,” Amuzegar says. By the end of 1955 the Communists “had been almost entirely wiped out.”</p>  

<p>Much of this political clamp down was accomplished with U.S. support. In 1953, shortly after the coup, a small coalition of CIA and Israeli Mossad agents assisted the Shah’s new government in establishing its own intelligence organization: the State Security and Intelligence Organization, or as it was commonly known “SAVAK.”</p>

<p>Dubbed by TIME Magazine as “Iran’s most hated and feared institution,” one characterized by “virtually unlimited powers to arrest and interrogate” and that had “tortured and murdered thousands of the Shah’s opponents,” SAVAK became known for its brutality, societal omnipresence, and infamous “abuses.”</p>

<p>In 1976, Amnesty International (AI) released a report expressing concerns about SAVAK’s iron grip on the country. “Suppression of political opposition is carried out by SAVAK with a system of extreme ruthlessness,” the report alleges, describing the methods the military agency had used to suppress political dissidence and regulate social order.</p>

<p>That same year, a report by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) expressed concern for how the country’s “movement towards greater parliamentary democracy since World War II” had “yielded to an authoritarian one-party regime.”</p>

<p>In the AI’s report, researchers painted a dire picture of Iranian society, showing that, since the coup, it had quickly slipped into totalitarian militarism. “Freedom of speech and association are nonexistent,” the report alleges.</p>

<p>To enforce this rigid social order, SAVAK had taken to using a “system of informers that permeates all levels of Iranian society.” These informers had successfully “created an atmosphere of fear” throughout the country, one frequently “remarked on by visitors to Iran,” the AI report showed.</p>  

<p>That fear was rooted in the fact that, after the Shah returned to power, Iranians were commonly “disappeared” off the streets, whisked away to hidden torture chambers, then cast before the judgement of secret military tribunals. Many were never seen again by friends and family. This may have been because, as the AI report stated, “allegations of death under torture are not uncommon.”</p>

<p>According to one senior officer in the intelligence corp, punishments for suspected Communist guerrillas and other alleged political dissidents ran a grotesque gamut that included the use of rape, sleep deprivation, glaring lights, live snakes, electrical cattle prods, solitary confinement and nail pulling. Other allegations suggested political prisoners were regularly subjected to scenarios in which they were hung upside down by their feet, beaten, then burned on their faces and bodies with hot poking irons.</p>

<p>As purges and terror escalated throughout Iranian society, U.S. officials allegedly maintained close ties to the monstrous organization they had helped to create. Indeed, according to a 1979 New York Times article, many of the torture methods deployed by SAVAK personnel on their victims were taught to them through “CIA torture seminars” that were based “on German torture techniques from World War II.”</p>

<p>The continued relationship between American intelligence services and the Iranians led in 1959 to a bilateral agreement that allowed CIA agents to work covertly within Iran, and, in turn, allowed SAVAK agents to operate in America.</p> 

<p>During senate hearings held in 1979, federal agents confessed that Iranian personnel were deeply embedded within American society–so embedded, in fact, that SAVAK agents were reported to be very “involved in conditioning U.S. opinions toward the shah and toward the Iranian-U.S. alliance” through various forms of propaganda, even going so far as to fund pro-Shah demonstrations in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The operations didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>Richard Cottam, a former CIA agent who became a professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh, reported to the FBI in 1976 that “Iranian assassination squads were in the United States.” These death squads, according to Cottam, were being used to target American citizens and students who expressed critical views of the Pahlavi regime. The modus operandi of the hit men was to “make executions appear to be common crimes such as muggings,” Cottam said.</p>

<p>A Washington Post article from the period describes an incident in which SAVAK personnel attempted to murder a student activist:</p>

<p>“In January, 1978, an official of the Iranian Students Association - the leading anti-shah group in this country - was lured to a meeting in Chico, Calif., where five bullets were fired at him. All missed. One of the two Iranians suspected of the shooting attempt was later linked to SAVAK in a Justice Department report to the National Security Council. The two accused assailants were acquitted at their trial.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason that the FBI did little with this information was that it too was collaborating with members of SAVAK, who would volunteer “detailed information on Iranian student organizations in the United States” to the Bureau, which, in turn “reciprocated with information.”</p>

<p>Further reports and investigations by human rights groups throughout the 1970s would continue to shed light on the ongoing relationship between the U.S. government and SAVAK, as well as the abuses, disappearances, and purges that characterized Iranian society under the Shah’s rule. SAVAK’s reign would continue until the Iranian revolution of 1977-79 when the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown by leftist and Islamicist insurgencies, ultimately to be replaced by the Iranian monarchy led by the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In the years after the revolution, American reporters visits to abandoned torture chambers in Tehran would finally provide the western public with insight into “the emotional accusations by Iranians of U.S. responsibility in a quarter-century of torture and repression under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.”</p>
